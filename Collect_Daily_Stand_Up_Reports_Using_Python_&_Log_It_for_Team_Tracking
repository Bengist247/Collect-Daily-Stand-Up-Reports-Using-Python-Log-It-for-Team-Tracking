✴️ Collect Daily Stand-Up Reports Using Python & Log It for Team Tracking

Hi Fam,
Today, I’m excited to share my hands-on Python script built to automate the daily stand-up status report process for team members in an organization.


With the script, I was able to get:
🔶 Users input
✔️ Name
✔️ Department
✔️ Group
✔️ Task for the day
✔️ Current location

🔶 Append it to a log file
It appends the collected status, with timestamp, into a file named Status.txt, which can be used later for team tracking or accountability.

🔶 Add date and time
To track when the entry was made.

🔶 Display it in a formatted output using f-strings. 
It prints a readable, personalized status update for the user.



In a hashtag#DevOps or remote team environment, this hashtag#PythonScript acts like a simple:
🔶 Daily Stand-Up Bot
🔶 Status Logger
🔶 Work-from-Anywhere Tracker

It’s ideal for small teams needing a lightweight way to document daily progress without complex tools.
